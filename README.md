This repository contains a collection of ASIC design assignments and exercises
implemented using Verilog HDL and TCL scripting.

These assignments were completed as part of continuous self-learning and
practice in digital and ASIC design. Each implementation focuses on reinforcing
core concepts such as:
RTL design and modeling using Verilog
Understanding the ASIC design flow
Writing TCL scripts for basic automation
Simulation and verification fundamentals

The work in this repository reflects consistent effort, hands-on practice,
and progressive improvement in ASIC and VLSI design skills.

## Work in Progress

In addition to the individual assignments, a larger ASIC-based system is
currently under development.

This system is being designed with attention to advanced design considerations, including:
Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)
Static Timing Analysis (STA)
Power-aware design
And other standard ASIC design practices
